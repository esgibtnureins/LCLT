    <h2>Mauvais Sang</h2>
    <p><strong>Mauvais Sang</strong> (French pronunciation: ​[movɛ sɑ̃], Bad Blood), also known as The Night Is Young, is Leos Carax's second film. Released in 1986, the film played at the 37th Berlin International Film Festival before being nominated for three César Awards and winning the Prix Louis-Delluc. The film had 504,803 admissions in France. The title refers to the eponymous poem by Arthur Rimbaud in A Season in Hell.
    In the movie, a sexually transmitted disease called STBO is sweeping the country; it’s spread by having sex without emotional involvement, and most of its victims are teenagers who make love out of curiosity rather than commitment. A woman hires two men to steal the serum, which has been locked away in an inaccessible government building.<p style="margin-top:40px;">

    <h2>Plot</h2>
    In the Paris of the not-too-distant future, a mysterious disease named STBO is killing people who make love without emotional involvement. A serum has been developed, but it is locked away out of the reach of those who need it. An American woman blackmails two aging crooks, Marc and Hans, into stealing it. Marc recruits Alex, a rebellious teenager whose father worked for him before getting himself killed. Although Alex has a girlfriend, Lise, he ends up falling for Marc's young lover, Anna.
